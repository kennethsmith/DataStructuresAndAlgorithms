# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

## Context
I have a lot of old/new code that I have consolidated and am trying to clean up. I am recently looking for a new role, a director in technology newly on the market, and found that a lot of companies expect developer chops still. Trying to refresh and add new!

This one is just pretty basic, just some algorithms and data structures. I'm adding OpenRewrite, Jacoco, PMD and Findbugs.
